# Here
Here is an innovative location-based augmented reality (AR) social app shifts the focus from the present moment to the here and now. 
With our app, users can leave messages or AR content at specific locations for their friends or the general public to discover. 
These planted messages become digital markers in the physical world, creating a unique and immersive social experience. 
Users can explore their surroundings and stumble upon messages from both old and new friends within a certain distance range, which initially starts at 10 meters but expands as messages gain more likes, views, and replies. 
Beyond personal connections, our platform encourages participation in large-scale public discussions, allowing users to engage in meaningful discourse about the world around them. 
Join us in redefining social interaction in the digital age with a fresh perspective on location-based AR communication.
